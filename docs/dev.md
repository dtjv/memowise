i'm really trying to figure out what is better, to design data model and user
flow logic before ui. but i think that approach is almost impossible - since you
don't know what data you need for presentation, nor functionality to support.

so, i feel much of the code i've written is throw away once i get the ui fleshed
out a bit more.
